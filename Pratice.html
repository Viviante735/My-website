  <section id="about">
    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I started my journey in product management after exploring various fields and discovering a passion for creating meaningful solutions. My background in early childhood education has shaped my empathy and people-first mindset, which I carry into every product decision.</p>
    <p>Throughout my career, I’ve worked on cross-functional teams, led product discovery initiatives, created user personas, and written PRDs to guide development teams. I also have experience with customer service, which sharpens my understanding of user needs.</p>
    <p>Outside of work, I’m always learning—whether through tech communities, reading, or mentoring others who want to break into tech.</p>
